Learning as well as reviewing important classic algorithms & data structures by implementing them in Java.

### Supplementary Books:
* Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), 3rd Edition, by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein
* Algorithms, 4th Edition, by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne
* The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Edition, by Steven Skiena
* Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition, by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell

### Online Resources:
* Algorithms, by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne on Coursera <br>
* Algorithms: Design and Analysis, by Tim Roughgarden on Stanford Lagunita <br>
* Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java, by Sarah Ettritch on Udemy <br>

### Recommendation on How to Use the above Resources:
I had a rough start when I first started learning these materials because I wasn't sure how the materials fit into the "big picture", so I hope the following advice will somehow save you some time hopping around looking for advice on WHAT TO LEARN FIRST & WHAT TO LEARN NEXT.
1. Be familiar with a programming language (I'd recommend Java/Python/C++)
   * Assuming you are using Java, it would be extremely helpful and would make it easier for you to understand the materials if you already know the following intermediate Java language concepts before you begin:
     * Generics
     * Comparators
     * Iterators
     * I/O
     * Collections
     * Design Patterns
     * Even Better:
        * NIO
        * Lambda Expressions
        * Java 8 Stream API
       
2. Read Prof. Robert Sedgewick's Algorithm textbook + take his two courses on Coursera (Algorithm Part I & II)
   * This book is for the second course in a typical CS program that focuses on the most important data structures and related algorithms. The writing style is a bit dry but the diagrams are GOLD!
   * Some people recommend Prof. Steven Skiena's The Algorithm Design Manual text over this one. I strongly disagree because you definitely need a good understanding of the fundamental data structures to understand the algorithms mentioned in Prof. Skiena's book. Prof. Skiena's book only has 1 chapter on data structures and only briefly talks about them (good for reviewing, not situable IMO for learning from the ground up).
   
3. Read Prof. Steven Skiena's The Algorithm Design Manual textbook + take his Stonybrook courses online (optional)
   * This book is for the third course in a typical CS program (usually named "Design and Analysis of Algorithms")
   * This book focuses on algorithm **design** techniques rather than simply explaining algorithms like Prof. Sedgewick's book does. The materials are grouped together in a way that is better than Prof. Sedgewick's book IMO.
   * It explains many difficult concepts in an easy-to-understand way and Prof. Skiena's writting style is more fun to read. All the jokes and interesting real-world examples make learning algorithms a lot more fun.
   * You need a good understanding of data structures to understand the materials. It briefly explains some important ones.
   
4. Use CLRS as a reference
   * CLRS is a really comprehensive and math-heavy text on algorithms. It is not meant to be read from cover to cover (although you can if you want to or have the time). I'd recommend using this text as a reference to review the materials that you have learned from the above two texts or learn some extra algorithms that the above two texts don't cover.
   
5. Practice solving algorithmic problems on LeetCode.com or from the "Cracking the Coding Interview" book
   * By now, you should already have a good understanding of the core data structures and some algorithm design techniques (Divide & Conquer, Greedy, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming, Brute Force, etc.). Knowing the concepts is already a big step forward. Now, it is time to practice solving algorithmic problems.
   * I'd recommend solving the problems from [this list](https://www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/5679846214598656) first because it groups problems into categories. Again, having a "big picture" or a mind map of what you need to learn in a sequencial way is really helpful. It saves you a lot of time from overthinking "What am I missing?" and "What category does this problem fall under?". **You don't have to pay for this. You can find the problems on GeeksforGeeks or LeetCode and then type them out and test there for free.**
   * I'd also recommend solving the problems **conceptually** (drawing diagrams and possibly writing pseudocodes) on a whiteboard and then code them out on the sites.
   * You can also buy the popular "Cracking the Coding Interview" and solve the problems on a whiteboard or IDE. Keep in mind that the solutions on the book might have errors, so be sure to take a look at its errata site once in a while while you're working through the problems.
   
### Tips & Tricks That I Follow:
* Day 1 of Learning a Data Structure or Algorithm: 
  * Understand the ins & outs of a data structure or an algorithm from the theory side before looking at any code.
  * Write pseudocodes for them.
  * Think about different small test cases and experiment with them on paper or whiteboard. For example, if I am reviewing QuickSort, I would come up with a few short lists of numbers and sort them on whiteboard using the QuickSort algorithm.
* Day 2:
  * Implement them the next day after you understand the theory behind the algorithms from Day 1. This helps me understand the concepts more than when I start implementing them right after I learned about them.
* Day 7: 
  * Review the concepts/theories and codes once a week, with a few days apart from each review session, until you are sick of it!

#### Note:
My focus here is on experimentations with the concepts and codes. It was simply meant to represent the concepts that I learned from the resources above.

Feel free to use any of the codes in this repo.
